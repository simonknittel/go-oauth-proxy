# go-oauth-proxy

Simple web application written in Go to proxy the OAuth authorization code flow with GitHub in order to prevent a leak of the client secret for frontend applications. This application then could be hosted on something like GCP Functions or similar.

_This project is work in progress and generally more like a experiment to me in order to learn Go._
